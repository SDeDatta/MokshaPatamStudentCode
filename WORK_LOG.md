| Sep 3   | 2:15pm-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I started by considering how I would find the shortest number of moves with a board of size 10 without snakes and ladders. After that, I considered how I would go through each position to find the furthest move possible. After figuring out how I would in theory, I struggled to put that into code without a board of sorts. |
| Sep 3   | 3:10pm-3:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I considered adding an array that held true or false to determine if there was a snake or ladder at each position I'm at. I then realized that going to the furthest point possible isn't necessarily the best way to get to the final spot. I struggled from there to figure out how I would "search" for the fastest past. |
| Sep 4   | 9:45pm-10:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I remembered someone in class considering BFS so I researched BFS and DFS from my old projects to figure out if either was usable in this case. BFS seemed to good to find a shortest path so I started to copy some of my old BFS code. I realized it may be easier to do BFS with a "board" of some sorts so I started coding that. |
| Sep 7   | 5:00pm-5:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I was smoothly coding BFS into this program until I realized I needed some way of determining whether or not there was a snake or ladder at a given spot on the board. So, I decided to make an array with 0 representing no snake or ladders, 1 for snake, and 2 for ladder. I used an int array for this. |
| Sep 8   | 8:10pm-8:35pm  |                                                                                 After coding the array, I struggled to actually check the board spot that a snake or ladder led to because I had no way of knowing what number ladder or snake the one I found was. I struggled a while with this issue until decided I'd try to make a "board" with values of snakes and ladders already implemented instead of my 0, 1, 2 system. I implemented this system successfully but quickly realized I need to fill the parts of the board without a snake or ladder with some number. I chose to make those numbers the actual board spot so I my "jumpArray" could represent where each spot actually takes you. |
| Sep 9   | 8:30pm-9:00pm  | I thought I was done but in class I realized that my count to return the number of moves it takes to get to the end wasn't working. Instead of incrementing a count variable every time I enqueue a node (which is fundamentally not the right place to iterate count), I decided to make a count array based on Mr. Blick's explanation in class. He explained that I could simply add one to the count when checking out the "next" positions I could go to. The count array then stores how many moves it takes to get to any spot on the board which allows an easy way to determine how many moves it take sto get to the end because you're simply adding 1 every "next" roll from "toVisit" (current). |
